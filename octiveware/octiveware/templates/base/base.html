Changes made: Added jquery function to traverse object permissions based off of user group permissions. 
				This is the only function you will need because as long as the base page is loaded in any 
				template, which should ALWAYS be true, then the JQuery will run and hide all items. 

				The JQuery script calls userObjects which is in translation_mockup/templatetags def: userObjects. 
				The template tag is a context processor which is variables that are automatically loaded for every page. 
				By creating the template tags and giving the path in translation_mockup/settings.py under TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS. As long as the base class is loaded into the page, this will get all user 
				objects and remove them. If there is no user, then the userObjects are empty and nothing is removed. 
				Works the same for admin, since admin shouldn't be hidden from anything, their objects will return empty so nothing is removed.

Changes made: Added more Jquery that checks if the administrator is in the object finding stage or if the page should be in regular mode. This check uses file check.js in static/js/check.js that stores the check and objects located as session variables. I chose session variables because if a user is in object detection mode, since we are using the same website that all the users use, we did not want to interfer with other users, so with session variables we are able to only change the outcome for the user/browser that is using them. Also added a dialog box using jquery ui dialog. Created a span around the majority of the body to handle the .click events to find the objects, and a div outside the span to enable the message body of the alert box. The alert box has three buttons which allow the user to continue(close and select, the user can also just select another item and it will change, do not have to use continue unless the user wants to follow a link to another page), Get object which stores the object as a session variable array usin JSON encode and JSON decode, and a Finish button that takes you out of object detection mode by changing the check state and redirects you back to the administrator page.
